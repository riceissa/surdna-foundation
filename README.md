## Instructions for doing a run

```bash
# If you need to scrape the data, run scrape.py first. Note that this script
# uses a somewhat sketchy method for detecting when to stop scraping (it checks
# for a particular error message), so if the script seems to go on forever, make
# sure it is actually collecting data.
./scrape.py lol.csv

# Once you have the CSV, run proc.py.
./proc.py lol.csv > lmao.sql
```
